<h3>Linear Equations</h3>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

<p align="ctnter"> ax + b = 0 </p>

<p>where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so don’t get too locked into always seeing an x there.</p>

<p>Quadratic Equation</p>

<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"> ax^2 + bx + c = 0 </p>

<p>where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.</p>

<p>The area of a circle (A)</p>

<p>[sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:</p>

<p align="center"> A = [sign] [sign] r^2 </p>

<p>or, when you know the diameter (D):<br>
 A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2 </p>

<p>or, when you know the circumference (C):<br>
 A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign] </p>

<p>Intersection</p>

<p>The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

<p> A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B } </p>

<p>That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.</p>
